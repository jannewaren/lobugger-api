# lobugger-api

This is a Rails --api application that doesn't do too much. It just..

1. catches all requests
2. prints out the params, headers and body nicely to console
3. does nothing

Useful for looking at the requests you are generating somewhere else. For example while developing something that calls an API, but you don't have access to that API yet.
